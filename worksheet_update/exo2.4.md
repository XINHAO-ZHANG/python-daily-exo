# 1
Write a function fibo() that takes an integer n as a parameter and displays the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to rank n. 
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.
The term of rank n, denoted fn is defined by f0 = 0, f1 = 1 and fn = fn-1 + fn-2 for n > 2.
For example, the call fibo(5) will display: 0 1 1 2 3
